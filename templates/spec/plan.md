# Plan of flight — SPEC-XXX

## Plan mode

- Origin: `planned`
- Reconstruction: `false`

For a post-hoc spec use:

```text
Origin: post-hoc
Reconstruction: true
This document maps the implementation after the fact. It is not evidence of prior planning or approval.
```

## Recommended approach

What is the minimum sufficient implementation and why?

## Reuse

What existing project capabilities will be reused before creating new ones?

## Implementation sequence

1. `S-001` — <step and reason>
2. `S-002` — <step and reason>

Active planned work records its current and next stable step in `.atena/state/plan.yaml`. A post-hoc plan is never activated as an execution plan.

## Approval checkpoints

Select one mode before the plan becomes executable:

- `per-plan` — one `PLAN` checkpoint covers the complete approved plan.
- `per-batch` — define stable batches before execution:
  - `B-001` — <tasks covered by this batch>
- `per-step` — each stable `S-XXX` step is its own checkpoint.

```yaml
mode: "unconfigured"
checkpoints: []
```

## Expected changes

- `<path>` — <change>

## Validation

- `<command/check>` — <expected evidence>

## Limits

- Max retries: <n>
- Changed-file budget: <n or not applicable>
- Cost/time constraints: <if applicable>

## Recovery

How can the change be reverted or recovered safely?

## Mandatory gates

- <none, or list destructive/security/publication/etc. actions needing separate approval>

## Approval record

For planned specs only:

```yaml
mode: "unconfigured"
checkpoints:
  - id: "PLAN" # PLAN | B-XXX | S-XXX
    status: pending
    approved_at: null
    approved_by: null
    scope_revision: 1
```

When the user approves a checkpoint, update its record. Promote the spec to `approved` after the first applicable checkpoint is approved; pause again before every remaining `per-batch` or `per-step` checkpoint.

For post-hoc specs, write `Not applicable — implementation preceded specification.`

## Step progress and prepared handoff

Revision: 1. Report actual ordered index/total, completed steps, remaining after current, activity and checkpoint. Preserve stable IDs when revising order/scope.

| Step | Objective | Inputs | Deliverable | Actions/checks | Checkpoint/status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S-001 | Define for this step | Identify ready references/revisions | Reviewable result | Actual verification | PLAN/B-XXX/S-XXX; pending or approved |
| S-002 | Prepare before S-001 ends | Identify dependencies | Next result | Actual verification | Matching mode |

At completion record result/evidence and prepare the next row before executing it. Preparation is permitted across a pending checkpoint; execution is not. On the last step reconcile and close state.

For a per-batch Approval record, identify membership explicitly:

```yaml
mode: "per-batch"
checkpoints:
  - id: "B-001"
    status: pending
    approved_at: null
    approved_by: null
    scope_revision: 1
    steps:
      - "S-001"
      - "S-002"
```

For per-step, each checkpoint ID is its own S-XXX. Approved records identify approver/time/source and the matching scope revision; neither a sample nor an active state assertion is approval evidence.
